dart stats
==========

**description**

  [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org) Performace monitor.

  Port of [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js) to Dart
  thanks to [Mr. Doob](http://mrdoob.com) for his great stuff, we needed a
  Dart version of this.

update
-------

Looks like I duplicated [this](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/stats) Dart package without noticing ... 
I forked the original [Github repo](http://financecoding.github.com/stats.dart/), 
and will try to get rid of this one on the [Dart Pub](http://pub.dartlang.org) to keep it simple 
(we don't need duplicates).


**WARNING**

*I you're on the M2 version of Dart, you'll probably get
errors when importing the library because of the use of Streams
However, the compatible "M2" code is commented out so it's easy to make it 
working*
